# Fullstack Development Challenge 9

## Welcome to the ninth Challenge of the UCLA Bootcamp!

In this challenge we were supposed to rework a starter code for a note taker application! Our rework will allow us to go to each page, post notes, get all the notes, and even delete them. To start, lets look at our requirements:

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save button
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears
```

## The Completed Challenge

After completing the challenge, we should now have a working server.js that lets us fully use all features of this application. From there, you should be able to make some of your own notes and delete ones that you do not want.
